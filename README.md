# F18HackISU

## Summary
This is a web-based application which allows users to design, simulate, and debug digital logic schematics. We will use a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript (using p5 libraries) to write the application and Firebase to allow users to remotely store their projects. A typical use for this webapp is for people who want to have on-the-go access to schematics/projects as well as for people who want to prototype their designs before implementing them on an FPGA or and ASIC.

## Built with

* [P5 Javascript](https://p5js.org/) - The Javascript libraries used
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - File storage and user database

## Compatability
Internet Explorer is not supported, but all current versions of Edge, Firefox, and Chrome are.
For more browser support/compatability details, look at [P5 Browser Support](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/blob/master/developer_docs/supported_browsers.md).
